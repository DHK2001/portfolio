The app features a bottom navigation bar with sections for Home, Search, Saved, and Profile. The main functionality focuses on Home and Search, both integrated with TMDB APIs. The Search screen allows users to look up movies and displays results dynamically. Selecting a movie opens a detailed view showing overview, votes, genres, budget, revenue, and production companies, all fetched from TMDB. The app uses fetch with async/await promises for API requests and custom hooks for data management. Strongly typed interfaces were created to handle the API responses and ensure type safety throughout the project.",

Each section features subtle animations using Framer Motion, and additional sections like Testimonials and Certificates are included. This project was created as practice to explore alternative approaches to portfolio design by building a single-page scroll-based site.

The app allows users to add favorite places by tapping the + icon, which opens a form to enter a title, capture a photo, and set a location. It integrates native mobile capabilities such as camera access for taking photos and geolocation. For location services, the app uses the free LocationIQ API to retrieve the user‚Äôs address when choosing 'Use Location,' or alternatively, users can pick a spot on a map with a live preview. Once saved, the place is added to the favorites list and displayed on the home screen. While small and simple in design, this project served as practice for working with native features like camera and location handling in both Android and iOS.",

Users can add new expenses via the + icon, entering a title, date, and description. Existing expenses can be selected to edit or delete. Data is displayed using FlatList for efficient rendering. The backend is powered by Firebase Realtime Database, allowing full CRUD functionality (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to add, update, and remove expense records. This project was created to gain hands-on experience working with remote databases and implementing CRUD operations in a mobile environment.",
