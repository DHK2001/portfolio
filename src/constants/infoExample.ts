Selecting a movie navigates to a detailed view with the movie‚Äôs image and summary. The project is organized into two main modules‚ÄîListOfMovies and DetailMovie‚Äîeach following the VIPER pattern (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router). This approach ensures clear separation of concerns, easy scalability, and maintainable code.

It integrates native mobile capabilities such as camera access for taking photos and geolocation. For location services, the app uses the free LocationIQ API to retrieve the user‚Äôs address when choosing 'Use Location,' or alternatively, users can pick a spot on a map with a live preview. Once saved, the place is added to the favorites list and displayed on the home screen.
